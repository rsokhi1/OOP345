*/

In this workshop we got the records from a file using the input file stream and we counted the number of instances of the records. We also usde the chrono library for the very first time in this course. The chrono library helps in getting the time details or you can use it as a stopwatch to calculate how much time it is taking to execute a function or a specific module.
We also used the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator, also the move constructor and the move assignment operator were also used in this workshop.
