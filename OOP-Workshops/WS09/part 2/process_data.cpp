	// TODO Improve operator() function from part-1 for multi-threaded operation. Enhance the  
	//   function logic for the computation of average and variance by running the 
	//   function computeAvgFactor and computeVarFactor in multile threads. 
	// The function divides the data into a number of parts, where the number of parts is 
	//   equal to the number of threads. Use multi-threading to compute average-factor for 
	//   each part of the data by calling the function computeAvgFactor. Add the obtained 
	//   average-factors to compute total average. Use the resulting total average as the 
	//   average value argument for the function computeVarFactor, to compute variance-factors 
	//   for each part of the data. Use multi-threading to compute variance-factor for each 
	//   part of the data. Add computed variance-factors to obtain total variance.
	// Save the data into a file with filename held by the argument fname_target. 
	// Also, read the workshop instruction.
